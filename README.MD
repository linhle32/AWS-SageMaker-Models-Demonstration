- Classification with `XGBoost` and `LinearLearner` (this notebook has the most detailed descriptions on each steps of using AWS SageMaker)
- Regression with `XGBoost` and `LinearLearner`
- Forecasting with `DeepAR`
- Anomaly detection with `SKLearn` and `RandomCutForest`
- Automodel using `AutoPilot`
